=> In class components in React, the render() method is responsible for describing what should be displayed on the user interface (UI). It is a required lifecycle method for all class components and must return a React element, which could be a JSX expression, a string, or null.

=> Key Points about render():

1. Purpose:

 - It tells React what to display in the DOM.
 - It can include JSX to define the structure and content of the UI.

2. Return Value:

 - The render() method must return a single React element (often a parent element containing child components or elements).
 - If there is no UI to display, it can return null.

3. Pure Function:

 - The render() method must not modify the componentâ€™s state or interact with the browser (e.g., no DOM manipulations or side effects).
 - It is a pure function of props and state, meaning it re-renders the UI whenever state or props change.

4. React Updates:

 - React automatically calls render() during the initial rendering and whenever the component's state or props are updated.
