=> To pass data to a component using props in React, you simply include attributes in the JSX tag of the 
child component and set their values to the desired data. These attributes are then accessible in the child 
component as properties of the props object.

 => Steps to Pass Data Using Props:

1.  Add attributes to the component tag in the parent component:

<ChildComponent name="John Doe" age={30} />
Here, name and age are props being passed to ChildComponent.

2. Access the props in the child component: In the child component, you can access the props using the props object or destructuring:

function ChildComponent(props) {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
            <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
        </div>
    );
}

Or using destructuring:

function ChildComponent({ name, age }) {
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Name: {name}</p>
            <p>Age: {age}</p>
        </div>
    );
}
